**Title**:
User Login and Register System


**Project Description**:
1. This project is about making a system where people can create an account, log in with their username and password, and then exit the program. It is like the login page we use on websites to enter our account. The project will help users register their details safely, log in using those details, and exit when they are done.


**Features in the project**:


**User Registering**:


1. A person can create an account by entering their username and password. The system will check if the username is already taken, and if not, it will save the information.


**User Login**: 
1. After registering, the user can log in by typing the same username and password. If the details are correct, the user will be allowed to log in.


**Exit**:
1. The user can choose to exit the system whenever they want.


**Programming Language**:
1. I will use C++ for this project because it supports OOP and is good for handling complex objects.


**OOP Concepts for the Project**:


**Classes and Objects**:
1. I will make different classes like Login . These will help control the different things that happen in the project.


**Encapsulation**:
1. The details like username and password will be hidden inside the class to keep them safe.


**Constructors and Destructors**:
1. Constructors will help set up the userâ€™s data when they register, and destructors will help clean up the data when they exit the system.


**And the Methods**:
1. Creating the functions to get the data of the user and storing the information when he register       and then a function when a user logins and a function when he exits .
